## Network Programming Lab


1. Implement C program in which the main program accepts integers to be sorted and sort integer elements using Bubble sort. Parent process sorts the integer in ascending order and the child process sorts in descending order.	
2. Implement a full duplex communication between parent and child process. Parent process writes Filename of a file on pipe 1. This filename is read by the child process. The child process writes the contents of the file to pipe 2. The contents are read from pipe2 by the parent process and are displayed on standard output.
3. Implement full duplex communication between three independent processes using named pipe/fifo. Parent process accepts sentences and writes in pipe1.Second process reads it and find the number of characters,words,sentences and write this output to pipe2.This is read by a third process and is displayed on screen.
4. Familiarize the basic network commands.
5. Implement TCP communication with client and server
6. Implement UDP chat with client and server
7. Implement a concurrent time server program using UDP chat.
8. Implement a concurrent FTP server program using UDP chat.
9. Write a C program to implement SMTP using TCP.
10. Write a C program to implement distance vector routing. 
11. Write a C program to implement distance vector routing. 
12. Familiarize the TCP Packet Capture Using Wireshark
